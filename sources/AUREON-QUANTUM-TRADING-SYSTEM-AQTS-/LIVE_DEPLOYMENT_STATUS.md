## 🚀 Three Ways to Deploy

### 1️⃣ TESTNET MODE (Current - Safe)
```bash
# Practice with your testnet balance (£10,784.95)
# NO REAL MONEY - Perfect for learning

npx tsx scripts/liveWalletDeploy.ts
```

**What happens:**
- Connects to Binance TESTNET
- Uses your testnet USDT balance (£10,784.95)
- Deploys full Queen-Hive network
- Spawns hives as equity grows 10x
- No real trades, no risk

**Expected output:**
```
Starting Capital: £10784.95
Final Equity: £8.86e+25
ROI: 3.2e+22%
Hives Spawned: 22
Agents: 230
```

---

### 2️⃣ LIVE VERIFICATION (Before Trading)
```bash
# Check your real Binance account
# Verify API credentials and balance

npx tsx scripts/liveAccountCheck.ts
```

**What it checks:**
- ✅ API credentials are valid
- ✅ Account trading is enabled
- ✅ USDT balance available
- ✅ Live symbols are trading
- ✅ Account permissions

**When to use:**
Before switching to real money, verify everything works.

### 3️⃣ REAL MONEY MODE (Full Production) 🔥
```bash
# THIS TRADES WITH YOUR ACTUAL BINANCE ACCOUNT
# REAL CAPITAL DEPLOYED - REAL GAINS/LOSSES

export CONFIRM_LIVE_TRADING=yes
npx tsx scripts/realMoneyLive.ts
```

**Prerequisites:**
1. Generate LIVE API keys on Binance.com (not testnet)
2. Update .env with live credentials
3. Have USDT balance in your account
4. Export the confirmation variable

**What happens:**
- Connects to your LIVE Binance account
- Fetches your actual USDT balance
- Deploys Queen-Hive with ALL your capital
- 5 agents per hive, real trading
- Each agent executes real limit orders
- Real P&L tracking
- Auto-spawns hives at 5x growth

## 🔧 Step-by-Step: Go Live

### Step 1: Get Live Binance API Keys

```
1. Go to: https://www.binance.com/en/user/settings/api-management
2. Click "Create API" 
3. Label: "AUREON-LIVE"
4. Choose "System Generated"
5. Complete security verification
6. COPY your API Key and Secret

### Step 2: Update `.env` File

```bash
# BEFORE (Testnet):

BINANCE_API_KEY=your_binance_api_key_here
BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_binance_api_secret_here

# AFTER (Live):
BINANCE_TESTNET=false
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_live_api_key_here
BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_live_api_secret_here

# Risk Settings (Conservative Start):
MAX_ORDER_SIZE=100        # £100 per trade
MAX_DAILY_TRADES=50       # 50 trades max per day
RISK_LIMIT_PERCENT=0.5    # 0.5% risk per trade
```

### Step 3: Verify Connection

```bash
# Test your credentials without trading
npx tsx scripts/liveAccountCheck.ts
```

Check the output:
- ✅ API Key present
- ✅ API Secret present
- ✅ Connected successfully
- ✅ Trading enabled
- ✅ USDT balance shown
- ✅ Symbols responding

### Step 4: Launch Live Trading

# EXECUTE!
npx tsx scripts/realMoneyLive.ts
```

3. **Risk Percentage** - Each trade risks only 0.5% of balance
4. **Confirmation Required** - Must export `CONFIRM_LIVE_TRADING=yes`
5. **Minimum Balance** - Requires at least £10 to start
6. **Graceful Shutdown** - Closes positions cleanly on exit
7. **API Error Handling** - Catches and logs all API errors

## 📈 Expected Behavior

### Healthy Session
```
✅ Agents actively trading
✅ Mix of BUY and SELL orders

## 🚨 Emergency Stop

```bash

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with 50 steps and MAX_STEPS=50
2. **Monitor Closely**: Watch the terminal for 5-10 minutes
3. **Gradual Growth**: After 1 week of success, increase MAX_ORDER_SIZE
4. **Daily Review**: Check Binance.com for all executed trades
5. **Risk Control**: Never increase risk % above 1%
